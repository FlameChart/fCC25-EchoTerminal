# fCC Gamejam 2025 August Project - Echo Terminal

## Prompt

### üïπÔ∏è The ‚ÄúLegacy Code‚Äù Jam

Good evening `@Echo Terminal`s! Your theme for the weekend is "**It Just Works**"!

### Constraints:

- Must use JavaScript without any modern build tools (no frameworks, just <script> in HTML).
- You can emulate old-school practices like `document.write()` or `tables` for layout ‚Äî bonus points for humour!
- Give your game a "retro" feel and concept if you want to go the extra mile!

### Submission

You must submit your work using [this form](https://forms.nhcarrigan.com/form/sd78CeG4Ic3kNfFFT-5f2HkNCVAkmkMWhdJdY4NqGsI) before Monday (see the timestamp above).

## Requirements

- Must be written in Vanilla Javascript, no imports or external libraries.
- Must be presented in a single page.

## Ideas

so the theme is "It Just Works",
it would be better to create some simple games like **Manufactoria, ShapeZ and other games**
that _themed in "Factory"_ and _featured with "Automations"_.

and based on the time limits, so its better to create a game that is easy to understand and play, with a simple interface and mechanicsthats means we must using lots of SVG/Emote to be the assets and use table for a grid layouts.

sadly i cant use TS in this project because its a "Vanilla Javascript" challenge.

okay so i came up with some random idea:

because this section is called _Echo Terminal_, so it would be nice if i just themed the interface with the Minecraft's Deep Dark color scheme.

and the name contains terminals, so it can be interacted with the _actual terminals_.

other ideas remains same.

---

uhhhh, the **bonus point** in the gamejam is _to have some retro feels_, so it can be some "Visual enhancement" with some scan-lines.

it wont be that hard and we can try to have some `<canvas>` to experimenting this.

so lets put this thing to the _last_, we must focus on the actual gameplay and level design.
