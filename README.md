# fCC Gamejam 2025 August Projet - Echo Terminal

## Prompt

### üïπÔ∏è The ‚ÄúLegacy Code‚Äù Jam

Good evening `@Echo Terminal`s! Your theme for the weekend is "It Just Works"!

### Constraints:

- Must use JavaScript without any modern build tools (no frameworks, just <script> in HTML).
- You can emulate old-school practices like document.write() or tables for layout ‚Äî bonus points for humour!
- Give your game a "retro" feel and concept if you want to go the extra mile!

### Submission

You must submit your work using [this form](https://forms.nhcarrigan.com/form/sd78CeG4Ic3kNfFFT-5f2HkNCVAkmkMWhdJdY4NqGsI) before Monday (see the timestamp above).

## Requirements

- Must be written in Vanilla Javascript, no imports or external libraries.

## Ideas

so the theme is "It Just Works",
it would be better to create some simple games like Manufactoria, ShapeZ and other games
that themed in "Factory" and featured with "Automations".

and based on the time limits, so its better to create a game that is easy to understand and play, with a simple interface and mechanicsthats means we must using lots of SVG/Emote to be the assets and use table for a grid layouts.

sadly i cant use TS in this project because its a "Vanilla Javascript" challenge.
